# Verification

How to check the project is healthy. This is a documentation-only discovery
phase; there is no build, product code, or automated product test suite yet.

## Current M0.1 verification — 2026-08-22

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Current local CLI baseline | PASS — Claude Code 2.1.241, Codex 0.149.0, Grok Build 1.0.5, OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2 |
| Sanitized native-auth status | PASS for Claude subscription OAuth and Codex ChatGPT login; Grok active login not tested |
| Fit-gap structural regression | PASS — 54 register IDs map one-to-one to 54 matrix rows; 11 non-empty system cells per row; priorities and cell syntax valid; 0 errors |
| Canonical architecture answer | PASS — exactly 3 copies and 0 byte-level line mismatches across `architecture-options.md`, `minimal-poc-plan.md`, and discovery `README.md` |
| Local Markdown links | PASS — 47 Markdown files scanned, 12 local `.md` links checked, 0 broken |
| Placeholder inventory | PASS with 3 intentional matches — all mark the still-open implementation-language decision (`PROJECT.md` once; `reuse-vs-build-analysis.md` twice) |
| Secret-pattern scan | PASS — 0 OpenRouter-key-shaped values and 0 private-key headers |
| Patch hygiene | PASS — `git diff --check` exits 0 |

The fit-gap regression is deliberately **structural**, not a second semantic
review of all 594 system cells. It confirms that documentation edits did not
drop, duplicate, shift, or corrupt a requirement row. The M0 matrix is trusted
except for the targeted AD-07 semantic correction documented in
`docs/discovery/evidence/m0-product-architecture-review-2026-08-22.md` F9.

No model prompt, OpenRouter request, live ClawTeam run, live OpenClaw run, or
Windows/macOS execution was performed. Hosted CI coverage is a future
milestone requirement, not evidence already obtained. No credential value or
authentication file was inspected.

Last verified: 2026-08-22 by Codex (credential-free documentation review).

## Historical M0 note

The W3 critic/fix-pass artifacts remain historical evidence. Current project
state does not rely on the former future-dated owner-read-through claim or the
former claim that no placeholder markers existed.
